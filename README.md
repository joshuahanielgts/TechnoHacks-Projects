# TechnoHacks Projects - Python Development
## Overview

This repository contains two Python-based applications developed as part of the **TechnoHacks** Internship. These are projects focus on creating simple, yet functional applications that solve real-world problems using Python.

### Projects:
1. **Simple Command-Line Calculator**: A calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Weather Forecast Application**: A weather app that takes a city name as input and fetches real-time weather data via the **Yahoo Weather API**.

## 1. Simple Command-Line Calculator

### Description
This Python application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

### Features:
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully
- Allows for multiple operations in a single session

### How to Run:
1. Open the `simple_calculator.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells and input the desired numbers for operations.
3. The calculator will display the result of the operation.

## 2. Weather Forecast Application

### Description
This application fetches real-time weather data from the **Yahoo Weather API** using **RapidAPI**. The user provides a **city name** and the app returns the current weather, including:
- Temperature (in Celsius)
- Weather conditions (e.g., clear sky, cloudy, etc.)
- Humidity

### Features:
- City name-based search for weather information
- Fetches real-time weather data
- Displays the data in a clean and readable format

### How to Run:
1. Open the `weather_forecast_yahoo_api.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Enter the name of any city when prompted.
3. The app will fetch the weather data and display it in the output.

## Requirements

Both applications can be run directly in **Google Colab**. The following tools are used:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**: `http.client`, `json`
- **API**:
  - **Yahoo Weather API** (for the Weather Forecast App)
  
No additional installations are required since all dependencies are handled within the Colab environment.
